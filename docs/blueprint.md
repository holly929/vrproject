# **App Name**: EduImmerse Ghana

## Core Features:

- VR Module Display: Display interactive VR modules with 3D models and simulations, rendered within a React Native application using platform-specific modules for performance.
- Intuitive UI/UX: Implement a user-friendly interface in React Native for content navigation, progress tracking, and settings management.
- Offline Access: Support offline access to downloaded VR modules for uninterrupted learning in areas with limited connectivity.
- Content Management: Develop a content management system (CMS) that allows educators to upload, organize, and update VR content, accessible through a web portal. Facilitate integration with native device capabilities to enhance performance. Utilize React Native's bridge to call native components.
- Adaptive Difficulty: Integrate a tool powered by generative AI to dynamically adapt the difficulty level of VR modules based on user performance and feedback.
- Feedback Integration: Incorporate feedback mechanisms (e.g., quizzes, surveys, and virtual annotations) to assess student understanding and gather insights for content improvement.
- Training & Onboarding: Incorporate training modules with step-by-step tutorials within the application to improve user proficiency and ease technical anxieties of using a relatively novel system.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to convey trust and intelligence in educational content.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5) for a clean, distraction-free learning environment.
- Accent color: Vibrant orange (#FF9800) to highlight interactive elements and CTAs, promoting engagement.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use simple, intuitive icons that clearly represent functions within the VR modules. All icons will follow a consistent design style, and their symbolism must reflect concepts that are accessible to users from the target demographic.
- Maintain a clean, uncluttered layout within VR modules to avoid cognitive overload. Arrange the virtual space so as to minimize extraneous or conflicting visual elements, with clear navigation and interactive elements.
- Incorporate subtle animations to guide users and provide feedback, enhancing interactivity without overwhelming users.
